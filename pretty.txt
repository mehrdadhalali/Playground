Here lies the text, why is the word "is" red? No clue
A monad is a monoidd in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?
Actually, a monad is an internal monad in the bicategory of categories
But also an endofunctor that looks like a monoid

A monoid is a category with one object

A category is a monad in the bicategory of span(Class)

None of this is even remotely useful
